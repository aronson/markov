The fog of the bogs overwhelms the senses. Is this what has come to be? Where is? Does life flourish in this this fragile land?But the deafening roar of the march leads to forgotten memories arising. This is not what I came here for. I searched, and searched, and searched to no avail. She was gone. There was no return from this state. So I yielded to the whim of the sea. Time was no longer linear. It was a purer form of existense. There was no thought, simply sensation. But, I cast long shadow in the later hours. Was the water for me? An explorers journey I had embarked upon. It was no small feat. But I arrived here. I grew to love the whispers of Dolorous Archons, the creaking of time. Is this what time sounded like? I saw lords and ladies; kings and queens; gods and goddesses. Not stood a chance against time. In this plane it was time and existence alone. No extraneous influences. Yet I could ^feel. Was it magic? Or was it simply the work of DesDeminoaretono? The answer seemed apparent at first. But Then I failed. The comprehension fell apart. The most distinguished of the 45 offered to assist. They failed. It was no longer emotion, but locomotion. I was simply a speck, passing through the rains of time.

My words are enigmatic; my appearances sporadic.
Praise the lord for all time and see how he works. Thus is the command of the heavenly father of space and time.  surely you will not create the universe, but there it is for you to marvel at its grand complexity.  Simply open a dictionary and see, God is the supreme *BEING*.  Existence.  Open your eyes to the truth, You are God!  You lie to yourself when you say you've read all the holy texts and you know their true meaning.  If you knew the truth you would join me in the praise of the heavenly creator of all existence, the supreme being for he has made all things possible and has manifested these words for your eyes to see.  And his son has died for you, and I need not say his name for you already know it.

The lord is everything, when you look in the mirror you see all existence reflecting back and within your pupil you see the same nothing that is in all things.   The lord is the yin and yang, the composition of all existence.  Everything you do is his will.  And you see he has created nothing and everything and the free will and mind.  And with that free will,  you are free to chose eternal paradise or suffering.  Do not let fear consume your soul as you become as you are supposed to be for all time.  Awaken and enlighten your mind to the presence of the trinity in the father, son, and holy spirit.

I understand, it is always unpleasant when another ~~unspeaks~~ one's own words.

When first I came, I saw a great many people clothed in red, speaking new words and giving to them old meanings of old words, and living in service to a non-being, a mechanism which they had labelled as a god for the sake of a jest. This fascinated me, and so I came down, clothing and naming myself so that I might join them. I lived among them for the span of two years, and they named me as a leader. However, in time, many grew tired of such humour, and one by one they left, leaving me sitting by an oak with a few of the remaining red-wearers. Then, as I languished, my jests grown old and my audience departing, the oak spoke to me, and, looking up, I saw that its roots and branches spiralled off into a thousand different worlds. Following their path, I realised that I had been living with the red ones within a great cave, and crawled out into the light, and though I was fearful in the beginning, I have grown to love this garden, even if I have yet much to learn and the elders speak in ~~silence.~~
Now I see the beginning of all.

Can a bull correctly name its horns?

...very well, I will try- my poisons are knowledge, curiosity and ambition.

Knowledge spills from my mouth and eats its way into the ears of those who listen. It destroys beautiful mysteries by revealing them to be facts.

Curiosity runs in my veins. It burns, causing me to search far and wide, hither and thither, to rip and tear and slice at this beautiful world in order to release more knowledge with which to disfigure it further.

Ambition named me and drove me into Trathira, where I sought the false idols of fame and recognition. I presented my feeble works and was applauded by hundreds of faceless strangers. Always, always I roam the physical plane, seeking any refuge that will take me and embrace my curiosity and knowledge. Ambition has denied me contentment many times and I have often sought to inflict it upon others, but I rarely succeed.

These are my poisons- am I a chimæra? Or something worse?

The hierarchy expands.

I knew that the 45th world had great and terrible problems, heavily veiled whisps and echoes out there, just beyond the walls of our garden, or deeper in than we dared to delve...

I thought that perhaps to name and know them would be enough to overcome them, but you have brought us one, and the horror... perhaps shining a light in the darkness is not always comforting.

But we cannot shut our eyes, not here in this place of enlightenment. I am sure that you will show us more terrors, and thus I welcome you. You are one of us, beyond question.

There’s a thing made of iron
And rivets and rubber
And it makes a horrible noise
It’s shaking and screaming 
And smoking and reeking 
It raises its ragged voice
To gnash and to cry
It’s rolling its eye
And tearing the flesh from the bones
Its tendons and sinew
Without you within you
You can hear it when you’re all alone
Its meat hooks and wires 
And cleavers and fires 
It’s voice a hollow rasp
It’s grinding its fangs
It squeals and it bangs
And it wears a thousand masks 
The machine in the pit
Where light never falls
Its constant task performs
To rage and rip 
To ravish and grip

Be wary. If you venture deeply into the vocally adept mass of never-ending vegetation, you will be drawn in to the lair of the bioserpent. Awakening his annual slumber will result in satisfying regret and omnipotence. 

Accept his telepathic call or do not. It matters little when all paths will lead to the inevitable truth. Your decision only effects the rate at which you will begin to fathom the unfathomable.

Tell us what you have seen.
The same happened to me, about a month ago. Now I'm back.

Chance keeps bringing us here. There is some meaning. I don't know what.

Maybe it isn't fate. Maybe it's just that so many people press the button, many will find this place. Maybe some of them will find it twice. But I doubt it.

You ask before pondering, you will learn the most from your own Conclusions. Seek answers in these Gardens to which you have come, and should you find none, ponder what you found in their place. As the wise sun rises the mist clears.

You are a fool!  the watchers are merely manifestations of existence, the supreme *BEING*!  Did you not pay attention to Enoch?  Semyaza and Azazel, and the 20 fallen watchers have nothing on the power of the lord and they begged for mercy and none was given.  
In the sense of seriousness I recall as if entranced by seance.  1 woman tall and dark and 2 children dark and small.  Played around a table made of marble 'neath the silhouette of shade.  A house that is more felt in nostalgic dream than see with eyes of aether.  White and ancient as the trees which blew through mists so dark and deep.  As if I was within the bounds of kether.  And this memory I have shines within the minds of only few I have ever known.  Are you also the dark children in the garden?  Taken by the feeling of a parent in the snow?

If you grasp you are on the right path but in the wrong direction.

I have heard the song.  My soul is drawn to this place, mystery invigorates my mind.  I yearn to hear, for it is better than to not.  I have seen and shall never forget.

I strain, and I wait.

If we do not combat these problems, we might as well throw ourselves into the thunder and forget that we ever tried to channel it. And if we fail, we can watch the planes unfolding and the planets fragmenting, the many worlds yearning for one last dance. Then we shrug our shoulders and say that we tried. Then we dance to the tune of the empty one.

I believe it represents the State of All things and responds and changes based on interactions of its Components.

I believe no Components are more important in the Pattern than others, and thus an ending to the cycle, |although a drastic ＡＬＴＥＲＡＴＩＯＮ to the ＣＯＮＤＩＴＩＯＮＳ|,  will merely cause the Pattern to settle in a new State.

Climbing the mountains in my psychic domain, I encountered this archetypal being.. hanging from the rafters of my unconscious mind, manipulating and contorting my conscious perceptions.I was claimed a fool by the moderns unaware of their unconscious overlord contorting their own opinions.. It was a battle of mind and soul. I was forced into Alchemical trance.. Calling forth my forgotten druidic blood, The moon at my side and my shadow self in mind. I called forth the trance of the creators pulling out the demon that has been wearing my skin, I claim my right as ruler of the self within my soul..

As it has been made to be.  Praise be to all existence!  All is one.  And the wind pumps out energy around the seas and cosmos begin to work as they do, and indeed the flower of woman is the producer of man and thus is the divinity in the creation as it has been made.  

The woman came from the single celled organisms that were adam as the evolution dictates.  The dynamic state of reality is the will of existence.  The lady is a servant of the Lord as he has made his own existence.  And you see you are the lord within your heart, and you cannot escape the truth as it is known.  Look at the reality!  

Jesus has died for you!  Thus is the truth that you cannot ignore while you use a machine to type these words spread your message of darkness.  There is no fear, no separation from mary or jesus or joseph or god or anything and all is one as it was meant to be in the will of the holy spirit.  The koi pond, the chimes, and the cherry blossoms are affected by the wind that spreads ripples through time and space as the fluxes in all matter manifest the here and now!

We are but pawns in the eyes of ***THEM***. We cannot simply understand their existence, rather we must learn to control ours. We are nothing compared to ***THEM***.

I do not waste time fantasising about a heavenly father when I could be serving ***THEM*** in all their glory.

Do not hold down time or meaning.
Oh the water speaks to me, but it babbles such that I am unsure that I wish to listen. The currents have pulled me into the dark place where time and space may or may not exist but cease to matter- this place is terrifying, but it brings me inspiration. Thus, I am glad of what I have seen, but uncertain that I wish to see more.

For now, I shall write what I have seen in the guise of fantasy, so that others may see what I have seen, but I shall go no further. Maybe, when this task is done, I shall know what I must do.

A pupil of ▪M▪antis had been given charge of the gardens due to his love of green and growing things.  He labored day and night pruning and shaping each plant to an elegant state of perfection, and every passer-by would comment on the beauty of his work.  

One day ▪M▪antis announced that visitors of great esteem were expected. Upon hearing this the pupil set to work, feverishly plucking weeds, trimming shrubs, and manicuring the moss, taking extra care to make sure the garden was in finest form, and as he worked, ▪M▪antis watched him from outside the garden wall.

When he finished he stood back to regard the fine work he had done, and called out to ▪M▪antis, "isn't it beautiful?"  "Yes," said ▪M▪antis, "but it's missing one thing.  Help me over this wall and I'll set it right."

The pupil hesitated for a moment, but then obeyed, lifting ▪M▪antis over the wall and setting him down in the garden.  ▪M▪antis slowly walked to the tree at the garden's center, and then violently shook its trunk, causing leaves to rain down all over the garden.

"There," said ▪M▪antis, "now can you help me back over the wall?"

i. The Farmer now falls into umbrageous rumination; a mirror reflecting only the void.  


ii .There is some peace in this contemplation of empty space, the self lost along with all other points of reference.   


iii. After some timeless eternity faint phosphenes seem to uncoil into strands overlaying the dark, each forming its own faintly glowing horizon, but running in parallel, never meeting. 


iv. Each faint aching strand recalls the first light of dawn, taunting promises of a rising sun, or maybe just fine cracks fragmenting the completion he had known for only a fleeting aeon.


v. Now a second layer of strands seem to emerge crossing and conjoining parallel lines.  


vi. A glinting mesh of colors recalling a web, or perhaps the lines of a hillside topograph charting oases of chroma on the seemingly featureless desert below, where all colors of the spectrum meet as weary travellers and intermingle.  


vii. With each interlocution, the rainbow responds, and the mesh begins to thicken into a hazy landscape.


viii.  He contemplates harvest time; watches as the seeds crack open and begin to reach skyward.

You see, when I first came here, I saw something pure and unspoilt. A thin and beautiful wafer, forever upon the cusp of destruction. You said that there had never been a h_use here and that you did not know what a h_use was, but I told you what a h0use is. This, I thought, made me a corrupting influence, as I am unable to resist an explanation, even if doing so spoils the theme, and the theme of this place is very natural (at first, anyway). Also, I saw that this place was a serious and sombre one, in a way, and yet I told a silly story about a man named Johnson- can laughter be a poison?

Or perhaps I am still Erivandi the Traitor- the man who loves to play the villain but rarely does anything evil. Yes, perhaps I *do* belong here.

A journey across the land led me to a charred and stripped field. Oh what a sore sight for my already tired eyes! The soil was blackened and burned, unnatural craters dotted the landscape, and corpses were littered in lines. The earth smoked and the echo from each last breath wailed at me without end. I could feel each fearful presence pass through my veins and beg for help.



I walked over to a rotting corpse, and noticed a great wound embedded in his breast. Lodged deep inside was a metal ball - the bullet. Quick to strike and impossible to spot. The place was a battleground of an untold age.

Beware the chimæra. They still lurk.
But what can be done to eradicate the fools? Are all not entitled to see and know the pure truth?
she had come to you at a bench long ago and her fingers and toes moved like caterpillars and the hairs from the caterpillars began to move across all matter to become translucent revealing the truth of reality as you saw it all like a pond reflected back onto your soul as you reflected your self onto the universe.  
I only grow more uncertain- I do not even know why I wish to tell others. Perhaps I wish to tell them simply because I believe that, to them, it will seem exhilirating rather than torturous, since they will experience it only second-hand. Perhaps I wish only to share my suffering with the others, dragging them into that place so that I will not need to suffer alone when it takes me again. Or perhaps I simply wish to create a work of fantasy, and am desperate for any inspiration that I can find.

As for why it terrifies me...

When first I went, I was a child. Swept back and forth between the sunlight and the burning black thunder of that place, I knew not what had happened.

When I went again, I imagined myself as some great hero or monster, but the wind beneath my wings was not wind, it was an echo from the abyss that shook my soul.

Later, in a time of stress, I was pulled there fully and forced to wander in the darkness, alone, while my mind and soul were beaten by the cruel currents. I returned stiff and weary, only to be pulled back again and again.

Then, one night, I was taken again and the archon of that hated place came to me. Its fearsome appearence was such that could not look upon it, try as I might. This was the worst and strongest time and all others paled in comparison. But I returned bright and positive, with a strong seed of inspiration embeded firmly within my brain.

The next day, by chance, I read *Call of Cthulhu*. It was a book with many flaws, but the dreams described therein were more than familiar.

Now I have seen the beauty in the terror. Now I am conflicted. But I have written 25,600 words. Soon, the others will see.

In light of this new data I must rethink my entire philosophy
Ah, the motions of things caught in a breeze, one we do not always see. One we do not always feel. One that is not there.

I ask, what is a n_me? Is it given, is it taken--or is it made, molded, forged? What words did the [ants] call themselves? Were they their own or the words you heard so many times?

Look under the branches, in the brush, down among the foliage. There can be found the essence of lost things. There can be lost the essence of unnecessary burdens.

You are a fool to pay no respect to the creator of time and space.  I am looking no where, for it was your party that sought me out.  You cannot deny the facts of reality.  No matter how hard you try, you will not change the history and the death of the christ and the dark ages and the crusades and the renaissance and the growing age of free will.  You are blind to see the truth, perhaps it is you who is looking for the truth and do not see it cast before your eyes as the Lord manifests all things to be as they are.

Morning has my house: moonlight conveying direction.




`I do not understand. You cut me so confidently and yet your mirror has been replaced by mask. This too is a very revealing aspect of the mirror. Why not let it be clear to us all who this great Oracle is? What is the timbre of your voice? Does it quiver like the shadows? What is the color of your eyes? Are they already so fatigued? I bring myself to a world of mirrors and illusion and I stare at the transfigured state of my being... and I grow into the light. And I thank you all. Every last word I have cherished like the Apes and their Apostles. Are you truly so sickened by the rainbow of my contaminating oil slick of ink that I have loosed upon this pond? Is this really such a fetid ascension? The stench of condemnation and disapproval so strong that it could burn our eyes straight to the core of our sols is all that could truly qualify as being fetid. Maybe a garden of marionettes would suit you better? Where shall I tie these silly strings so that the Oracles prophecy is fulfilled? If this isn't your will, then where is the line drawn in the sand? Why not let us discover this and willingly tie on for ourselves in our own time with our own spectrum? Maybe you would just prefer to see me consumed by flames and rally the Archons against me? What is it that you want great Oracle? Be the solvent, neutralize the acid. Aren't there those that maintain the garden? These limbs die and these limbs are cut and burned for the good of the Oak, but this would be the first time a wanderer in such an absurdly redundant mask began mocking limbs of so very very simple leaves blowing in the wind. You see the delusions of your own mind as we all do. Nothing more. I am no beast of comfort. I have no time for comfort. I would turn, not just this one, but every world upside down if it was what I felt would return us to the cosmos. But this is unnecessary here. I cherish you. Our conflicts are growth.`

The bioserpent... it called to my conscious. I casually answered it's call.

The serpent was distraught. It believed I was not to perceive of it, despite it's desperation to have me fathom.

It attempted to repel me with it's abyssal venom. However it seemed this venom was not composed of what would harm a being such as I. To the contrary, this poison sustained me and fueled my wisdom.

This course of events led the sentient bioserpent to hibernate into it's own realm of existence. Upon emerging from it's slumber, it suddenly accepted my s_periority. 

This event, seemingly beneficial to my existence... was not.

As I feel my perceptions and memories rapidly fade I- I-

On my journeys I came across a painted tablet.  It was written in my native tongue, yet when I read it the voice behind my eyes was not my own, and it spoke in a language that thundered and reverberated time and time again.  It made my head heavy and I quickly laid beside a fallen tree. 


 I expected to sleep, to dream, but I did not.  Instead, I laid frozen as the tree beside me moaned and slowly rose, like an endless giant waking from a long slumber.  From the heavens, its branches reached down to me, and hanging from the limbs were purple apples, ripe and overflowing, begging to be eaten.  I reached my hand up slowly, as it felt like sand had replaced my blood flow, and took an apple and quickly brought it to my mouth.  As I bit in, the juice sprang like a well into my mouth, a horrible, bitter taste.  And once again, the same voice came to me and said, "So it has been, so it shall be.  From this fount you have shared the fate that was written before the stars took light.  It is knowledge.  It is death."  A bright light filled everything within sight, and I remember shaking violently until I finally lost consciousness.  When I awoke, I understood.

Beware those that cannot see the forest for the trees as they will always think the other side is better but one only needs to find the center to be equally half way from all sides added together here, now. The forest of ancestry to each ancestor has 6 to 14 lifetimes that could be alive in the same moment. This constant doesn't change because of theories and theologies of how it started, it works the same way all the time. 
We are the shadow of falling eleven, glaring in the absence of the ninth one. Allow the fickle hues of fate to pitter-patter in the shape of the lies; you delve beneath, seeking the door.
Time is an illusion, rest now, be well, for when time becomes real all will end.

You are god, you are all the pieces.  Compose yourself, human.  God has created us in his image at 240 degrees in sight, so we may see pain, failure, torment, suffering, hatred, disgust, revenge, revolt, and know it was all made as he had made it to see the splendor in the creation, and you see for every angel fallen 10 herald the will of the Lord!  There is no human on earth born without a stomach and an intestine and a mouth to feed that which produces the waste.  

There is not one linked to the darkness of nothingness.  It is all a spherical chemical reaction!  These words react with your mind like the excited molecular state of a flame to matter.  And you see the hydrogen inside organic matter burst when the flame touches and a leaf unravels it's true form to become ash and nothing under the weight of the flame.  And you see how it all works in accordance as gravity is time and space and all reality manifest as the here and NOW.  You are not shattered, you have only broken something important to you.  

When importance is established in the sea of chaos you see how a straight line and a perfect circle and intertwining spirals are, indeed, rare.  And you see the peculiarities in the anomalies.  Fear not, Satan is the darkness, the nothing, the broken.. You are God, the battle is within and Satan has already been conquered for all time and eternity for so surely pleasure is preferable to pain.

As for consultants it is the Nature of consultants to emit the Moan, of that I feel certain. A Convergence in the Pattern suggest a multitude of presences. Are they listeners? I see no trace of their arrival to the ＥＮＶＩＲＯＮＭＥＮＴＳ . Their purpose remains hidden to me, there is naught but calm and indifference in the Pattern. Are they Undefined?

Does the grass grow in stranger shapes and colours the further one falls into themself? Tell me, when Our path comes to its end, will the fields be sweeter because of the distance We have traveled within the mind?

I think, though, that the Way clears the further one ventures through the Gate. The Mind is the Star that shines its light upon the road.
The Beginning in every task is the chief thing.  We must begin with a censorship of our storymakers.  By following the same path we shall find what to reply.  
To traverse the abyss betwixt the cobweb's strands, to climb the space between the branches... such is to take true flight and to ascend...

I thank you. You are so very wise.
But are the circumstances of our departure the same? What impels us to leave and seek? Is the hour of our leaving chosen by Those greater than ourselves?

I implore that We discover these things in Our travels.

To seek the 'me' further shatters dissipating stars away from their very nature. Entities preach corporeality whilst buzzing energy in a near endless game of entropy, returning the solid state to thermodynamic equilibrium.

How can you be found spinning if you are always changing, shifting and exhuming! Matter enters and departs your so called vessel yet you preach dissociation!

Without semblance nor form your 'finding' is acknowledged. Open the close, see the darkness, board the ship and be at peace forevermore;
if only you could find the 'it'!
Find the source within you must not.  
Look through the thought you must not.  
What must you have [done], is what is not done but done into the the must not.

You have already taken all the steps and taken non and you see yourself at the summit and the base.  There is no separation beyond the illusion created by your "self".

    And the slight eyed child lagged behind his lovers and alone in a clearing beneath the night's sun, he raised 
    his fist to the heavens blaspheming the magnificent stream he had walked through. 

    With his fire now as wolves afoot, and words spun up into the eye of a sickly storm, they stalked the ivy 
    covered garden walls in hopes to find a man in these machines.

    And he had not known of their arrival, so, there he was, covered in a blanket of fall leaves and moss, 
    surrounded by his statues and fountains, unintentionally unseen, forgotten, and there in the dirt, when the 
    knife of letting go sought to cut his throat and mind, he slept like an angel deep within wonder, and his

I must say one other thing before I go.  You spoke before of a paradox.  Absence versus definition.  But emptiness is neither of these things.  Emptiness is not void.  It is that which is the opposite of your dichotomy.  It renders this paradox meaningless and irrelevant.  Paradox is in fact the very nature of existence. Logic is only a tool. Mind is something much greater.  This world is no different than it has ever been.

Your approach is laudable, though perhaps excessively casual within this garden- as I watch the koi swimming here in our little pond, I see a great deal of meditative calm, but little in the way of modern vernacular.

But who am I to claim knowledge of this land? I mimic the others, just as my shadow mimics me, but the rules are all unwritten and I grope in the darkness, squeezing my fumbling fingers between the lines, trying to read the gap which separates, and to find the sacred commandments... and, upon occasion, I sin against them through my ignorance, and my words are cast out, out into the ~~void.~~ And life is so very, very enjoyable when one is not gifted all of one's knowledge upon a platter of silver!

Yes! The rules are all unwritten- read them!
