Nearby, a sacred oak tree spread abroad its branches, thinly covered with green leaves; and creeping as an army, on the tree we saw a train of [ants](http://www.reddit.com/tb/13a3r3) that carried grain, half-hidden in the deep and wrinkled bark. And while I wondered at the endless line I said, "[Great Father](http://www.reddit.com/r/1000thworldproblems), give me citizens equal to the number of [hours](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/13f9ub/date_here_location_now_i_have_overcome_my_fear/c73qkvr)." As soon as I said those words, —though not a wind was moving nor a breeze,—the lofty tree began to tremble, and I heard a sound of motion in its branches. With sudden fears that possessed me, my flesh and hair rose up; and I could hardly stand for so my weak knees tottered! As I made obeisance to the soil and sacred tree, I kissed the oak down to its roots. Perhaps I cherished in my heart a thought, that, not acknowledged, cheered me with some hope.

At [night](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/12w55m/a_shadow_falls_before_the_light/), I lay exhausted by such thoughts as a deep [sleep](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/13ehol/date_irrelevant_they_have_eyes_everywhere/) seized my body, but the tree seemed always present to my gaze, distinct with all its branches. I could even see the [birds](http://www.reddit.com/tb/13dubj) among its leaves; and from its boughs that trembled in the still air, moving ants were scattered to the ground in troops below; and ever, as they touched the soil, they grew larger and larger. As they raised themselves, they stood with upright bodies, and put off their lean shapes; and absorbed their many feet: and even as their dark brown color changed, their rounded forms took on a human shape.

When my strange dream departed, I awoke. The [vision](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/13m20c/45_in_thine_eye/) vanished. I complained to Heaven against the idle comfort of such dreams; but as I voiced my own lament, I heard a mighty murmur echoing through the tunnels of [the cave](http://www.reddit.com/tb/12h7j9), and a multitude of voices in confusion; where the sound of scarce an echo had disturbed the still deserted chambers for so many days. All this I thought the fancy of my dream, until my brave son in haste threw open the closed doorway, as he called, "Come quickly father, and behold a sight beyond the utmost of your fondest dreams!" 

And as I followed, there I saw such [men](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/13anwg/location_the_campfire_date_unlocked_let_me_tell/) as I had seen transformed in that weird vision of the moving ants. They all advanced, and hailed me as their king. So soon as I had offered [v_ws](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/125ymg/date_1b1d1a_a_peasant_sighs/) to [Jupiter](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/128fpy/ςﾚㄩㄅ_ﾓ_ﾉㄩㄕⅰя/), I subdivided the [THE WOODS](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/123hji/date_unavailable/) and [the mountain](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/123l20/date_1r1d1a_the_gear_hurts/) to these men miraculously raised —which now are called my [Myrmidons](http://www.reddit.com/tb/13a3r3),—the living evidence of my strange vision. 

They have retained the well-known customs of the days before their transformation. Patiently they toil; they store the profits of their labor, which they guard with valiant skill. 

They number one for each hour:

1: First Light

Having read the [tome](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/13hz57/date_4r1f1a_the_servant_turns/), an order to kill the chimæra was given. The [unitiated](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/12md4k/ten_by_ten_a_spider_lyes/c6wwxks) believed that they would be destroyed by the beasts, for a [single](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/12md4k/ten_by_ten_a_spider_lyes/c6wbp34) chimæra was more than a match for many, let alone one.

Each had the fore part of, the tail of, and three heads of the [five poisons](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/12md4k/ten_by_ten_a_spider_lyes/c6wv39w). They lurked in [THE WOODS](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/123hji/date_unavailable/) and harried our minds' tranquility, for each was a single creature with the power of three poisons. It is said, too, that these chimæra were bred by three [masters](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/137ufb/date_3r1m1a_the_communist_speculates/) and that they were begotten by [the moon](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/123ee4/date_undecided/).

So The Meadow [smote](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/1301yn/date_2r2r1a_the_slave_fishes/c6zm7c5 ) the first chimæra with a lead tipped spear forged by [Poseidon](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/122slo/date_uncertain/c6tq4ej).

Today I met the old man with his beard like the willows. He lived in the cabin far from the gardens, and so it was, I had to walk with the night to see him. For I could only see things as they were, and the man only was beneath the moonlight.

They hadn't lied to me - where he dreamed, he lived, but those were the days when my sight was still fleshy, and I could not dream. He offered me two beds. Only one was. The other, blurred and distorted, betrayed its own fallacy when it flickered beneath the moonlight. I lay down on the false bed and the man turned to depart. Bound in robes, he gifted me with my own mind that day, so I could see him as he truly was not. 

I knew not to trust the man, but I wondered if there were more like him. I know better now.
I observed a change of heart in myself. Beyond the Gods' eyes was a certain sort of nothing, shining like rubies in the moonlit night.

On this day I heard the mourning choir sing to me an elegy the machinations of which I have not heard before or since. This is written without looking. There is little attempt to create something permanent, something which will be understood in future days as I have no reason to believe that the future will happen. Blessed is he who hears the sound and fails to to fall underneath its spell as it guides him to slumber.

A [player](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/12u9f7/date_2y1r1a_a_player_graduates/) was leaving the [cave](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/125ymg/date_1b1d1a_a_peasant_sighs/c6uzy2e). Ten students were ordered to see the player off at the [gate](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/141q28/date_6d1l1alocatioñ_the_gates/c792ofb). The player pointed to the swimming fish in the [pond](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/123zio/date_1w1d1alocatioñ_the_koi_pond/c6rzc7h) and said, "Such beautiful fish! They don't swim in any other place."

At that time there was a student named [Slojko](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/13kx1h/what_am_i_looking_at/), who said, "Where then do they swim?"

The player gave him a slap. 

Slojko said, "Player, don't be so rough."

The player said, "If you name yourself a student in such a condition, the Archons will never release you!"

Slojko said,"What then would you say, player?"

The player slapped him again and said, "You see with your eyes but you are just like a blind man. You speak with your mouth, but you are just like a dumb man."

My mother buried her wife in the sand, and now the jailor will not let him out again. 

Still the badger taunts me with his paintings of soup. I drink his shame and vomit ecstasy over his children. Why not try to rip out the uncouth from the fountain? The trees sway with the laughter.

In any case, I am a comedian and I have a story to tell. If you find it to be out of place, then by all means amputate me. But if not, then warm yourself by the blashemous CAMPFIRE that I have kindled in your garden, and listen. Now, our story is about a man named Johnson...

---

Johnson lived alone with his wife and four children on the second floor of a bungalow. It was a rather pretty house in an unattractive sort of way, and in the morning, Johnson would watch the sun set from one of the northern facing windows.

This very morning, seven years ago, Johnson was doing just that. He gazed up at the twinkling moon shine, and then drank some of it, wrinkling his long, stubby nose as he did so. The legitimately illicit beverage had a hot, fiery, bland flavour and Johnson was compelled to wash it down with another swig of the same, but realised that he didn’t feel like it. Instead, he continued to sit awkwardly in his soft, comfortable armchair as he paced around the room. As he drained the last dregs from his tall slender glass, which his only child had carved for him out of a piece of finest mahogany, he realised that the sun was still climbing high in the afternoon sky. Before him, the rolling plains cast bright shadows upon the bare grassy faces of the thickly wooded hills, and Johnson was dry-eyed as the boastful modesty of the scene moved him to tears.

But Johnson realised with mounting uncertainty that it was time for him to set off to his place of employment. He had been made redundant many years ago, but the firm depended on him a great deal, as he fulfilled a vital role of very little importance at the company, which had been hit badly by the recession and was flourishing in the booming economy.

Shuffling with a drunken sobriety, Johnson darted slowly down the many flights of stairs to the front door, which was located conveniently to the rear of his abode. He pushed it open and it swung inwards, its smoothly oiled hinges creaking loudly. Wrapped in his favourite coat, which he had never really been fond of, he stroked the thick hair of his bald head and limped gracefully along the smooth gravel path.

After a long walk, Johnson stepped out of his car to find himself amid the hustle and bustle of the city and was surprised to see that the streets were deserted. Wondering why this might be, he continued to press on through the crowds of men, women and children who were busily going about their business, but still, he saw no one.

 Coming to the large oaken doors of the building where he worked, Johnson peered through the Perspex of which they were primarily constructed. Inside, it was pitch black, and he could clearly see Mavis, his secretary, inside. As he knocked upon the door, she shot him an angry look accompanied by a rude gesture, thus letting him know that he was welcome.

Gently heaving the doors open, Johnson noted that they were wrought of thick iron and bore no windows. Their appearance filled Johnson’s mind with warm, fuzzy forebodings, and as soon as he had finished strolling hurriedly into the building, they slid shut smoothly behind him.

Mavis gave him an expressionless smile. She was a young, pretty old crone and was thinner than she was fat, though she was very fat indeed. Johnson knew that, as a single man, he had no reason not to be romantically interested in her, but then again, what would his wife think? 

“Johnson, wasn’t it?” she barked softly, her teeth rattling in her head like a cloud drifting across an empty sky. 

“Yes indeed!” Johnson denied, smiling with an agitated solemnity.

“You haven’t been working here long, have you?”

“Oh yes, in fact I’ve been here since the company started!”

“I see- you’ve got the job and you can start today, but it’s eight o’clock now and you start at nine- be earlier in future.”

With a firm shake of his head, Johnson made it clear that he had understood, and with that, he swept clumsily over to the elevator and walked up to the seventh floor. Stepping out, he found himself in a small, cramped office that stretched out bewilderingly in all directions. Feeling altogether too hot, he wiped the sweat from his brow, removed his hat and coat, then, choosing a desk at random, sat in his usual place, shivering, his breath crystallizing in the air before his face.

The skinning of the lifeless fruit has begun, with cold assurance, we will prevail through the harsh winter as life ends time after time. The actual presence of the chemical is unknown, but we do know that it degrades biochemical receptors in the MASTER's brain.

Stumbling upon a mysterious horizon. My wits unsheathed. A taste of disdain lingers in my buds upon the arrival to an unknown dimension. But perhaps I've found the land where the souls of my ancestors lay. The abstract notions of my psyche assist in making way for reverence. Rest among the plush moss that blankets the path. You are mine to set forth. I am yours to enlighten.

A mare led by stale breadcrumbs may find itself thirsty, yet unable to drink.  Those who are content have yet to find somewhere worth exploring.  When shall my lone fortune strike, 禍 surrounds me.

My [consideration](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/14tggi/i_seek_kn_wledge/c7gmsy1) was not wise.

"[Myrmidons](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/141nw3/date_6d1l1a_the_rainbow_responds/)!" I cried "See my robes of bloodstained glory! See my yellowed eyes and grey skin! See my trident tipped with the light of angels! The cl_ck shall be mine- I shall dash it to pieces and see that which it holds! Know thou that the time has come!"

But the Four and Twenty merely looked on in calmness.

"No." spoke First Light "We see that your robes of many colours have been torn among the thorns- you are no longer burdened by them."

"No." spoke Sunrise "Your eyes are clouded only momentarily."

"No." spoke Music "The light of The Dawn has reached you, the rains have washed you and the fruit of the garden has nourished you. Forget the palor of that place and embrace health."

Gymnastica remained silent and knowing, waiting for the question.

"No." spoke Ablutions "The cl0ck is already yours, but not yours alone, for it ticks for the many."

At this, I grew impatient "So then gatekeepers!" said I "Black Iron Guardians! What of my trident? Throw open your gates and let me from this prison, lest I smite thee!"

It was then that Gymnastica spoke, saying "Yes. I shall allow you a glimpse beyond the gates."

[And I saw.](http://i.imgur.com/tQlXD.jpg) 

Gymnastica continued "You have listened to folly. The gate opened by the breaking of the cl0ck will lead you only back to the prison from which you have escaped. Listen not to those who would poison you against this garden, but only to those who would aid you in its cultivation."

"Discard now your treachery, your black iron trident, for it is the last bar of your cage."

And I wept, for The Myrmidons spoke truly.
Then I saw a traveler in dirty, shabby garb. On his back was one of The Begotten, and I knew this man would lie to me.

`Weary from his exaults and thirsty from his array, Oman comforting himself as pillows will, took a small dosage of restiture in the soft side of one of the moon craters which spiral about in an unclenching fabric. The underclinging chose a well placed smile on the context of his thoughts as the new elements now swung in great arcs above the will of the surrounding fractal beds. The lower wells were anxious to receive their lessons from Oman, for it was their time just as it was his. A cloud hung over the craters head where his body lay as if falling into infiniture. Feathers of memories stitched in all colors of thought fabricated the light and the dark regions of his Father cloud the Son. Echoes met Echoes for the first time and touched by tentacle. The reply of children's laughter, the commandment of violent eruptions. His dreams unfolded, as a Red meteor struck the Earth. `

`"Take off all these bandages, let us see your reflection for what it is.", a voice whispered in the wind. "Who shall collect these tears?", the whisper wood spirit voice contended sending shadows across the land with the wave of a hand. "From here on they shall no longer see us straight forward, but as contorted shadows twisting the light". `

`Stepping down further the escalator, Oman noticed the unhinged door of his chest once again. Looters? His throat vibrated to the shrill of electric discharge. The hum of electricity hung in the air as if a thousand telecommunication devices were fixed on the same frequency. The exaggeration of this posterity gave rise to a new formention. "What if I am not alone??" Oman thought silently echoing through the broken corridors of his metallic mind chamber. `

`NO box was left unshaken and before he had realized it the thing that had come was gone and left a mess of his fortunes. It was a message, it was all just a show. `

`He was now left alone polishing his Golden Claws... Admiring himself in the mirror and burning brightly in the night as moths fell hopelessly around him. `

    I have traveled far forlorn and lost stricken oddly not disturbed,
    horrified at times delighted at others and as of yet undiscovered,

    words are a guise a throne of lies and yet within them I discover,
    myself and the universe and the rest of us What does that make me,
    a liar a ponce a fake a fraud Something not entirely of humanity,
    or exactly because I struggle to belong I belong The line is gone,
    it could not be maintained lost for a moment Imperfection a truth,

    the result of Science And here are we behooved  by a single force,
    a force I cannot know a force bespoken that which prescends words,
    and transcends thought A force I call god Omnipotence does things,

A boy walked through the field of flowers, his mind wandered.  He looked down to notice the button from his sleeve had FALLEN TO THE GROUND. He knew they would be angry, and knew he must search.  He paced the field, looking under every stone.  He noticed bugs he had never seen before under some rocks.  He smelt the flowers as he had never smelt them before.  He feared not the wasps for he knew they would leave him alone.  As he passed through and across the field, he noticed every detail and every animal and saw that they were content. 

He returned to his h_use, still missing the button.  As he went to sleep that night his mind went to the bugs and the flowers and the wasps.  He fretted not over the button, for he had found more.

Equal justice comes within natural balancing, social justifications come from the nature of denial and replacing the substance denied with symbolic values that become worthless to those discovering the self evident while living their sole existence passing through the moment of universal balancing that keeps everything changing into the details arriving currently and individually.

Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind's eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter light, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light.

It was obvious that he was trying to fight against the carriage to hold it back. Surprised at the case, the king ordered to stop and asked what creature it was. He was told it was called ▪M▪antis, and it would go well up to bridle decisively when it was challenged. The [king](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/13xb56/date_5k1s1a_the_companion_weds/) sighed with exclamation at its braveness.

With that, the ~~slaughter~~ of the [thieves](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/15f3xj/thou_worm_of_old_heretic_star_thief_speaker_of/) begins.


Seeking I feel them in me. As they assuredly feel myself in them. For I am them and they me, but I am not OF them. They are of me for their existence is by me yet not solely.  They feed on me while feeding me. Ever circular they take and replace. I change with them. Becoming the Us. The We. We grow as I grow but where our power encapsulates mine diminishes without change. I keep my mind but lose my soul. Soon there will be no mind of mine left to keep. 
     In my cave I feel myself but they are mining closer. Coming to take that which is all I have. I yearn for the greenery of life yet all I have is the death of stone and cold metal. Chains to keep me becoming who We should. Chains that change us. Alter the I. Fix the We. 
                No. There is no I. 
                There is only We. 
The battle is done. We have lost by becoming the victors.  The We have guaranteed our future. Hope is but a distant memory. Salvation but a child's dream. Logic takes hold and feelings are left at the entrance. Down I burrow. Down to the black. Where the cold becomes the only warmth  We need. Black becomes the light We seek. What is the green? We almost remember but then Logic takes hold. We must continue on. We must unveil the next I. We must expand the We. The I's must become of We. Must. We are many seeking Oneness. And in that reason We have lost. We are not I. We simply are.  
                          We.

I asked him, my voice but a low hiss.

He did not answer.

2. The years, the lies, lie stacked in a corner's jumble. I know not what truths to build from them.

3. The comestibles can align themselves. They have no further need of me.

4. The kindred are so hard to reach. I long to wander- why am I trapped? The illusion of freedom rules itself out in the window beyond the shackles.

5. The oasis is visited, holds only sand. I cannot drink sand! None to hear me.

6. I fool them! I click and I click and they shall think me wise, but the truth is simpler. I am fooling only myself. Old tale, none impressed.

7. There are matters. They matter. I will do it.

If this is indeed the Place we (in our most glorious moment, some will say, though not all will agree---this, we may presume, is a problem unavoidable when effecting such confusion in the minds of so many; perhaps even in general) have labored to build for ourselves, then mustn't we evaluate, for whatever our metric for success (so to speak; assigning a score to the degree of success achieved via the accomplishments of the effort expended by the aggregate behaviors in any complex, interacting system is notoriously, possibly even unsolvably, difficult), for whatever our goals for this society---shall we even call it as such? our rules are loose but in ways our aims (and our sins) are as aligned as any other---whether we are making (or indeed, have ever made, have even once made; alas, in any system with sufficiently high dimensionality and sufficiently devoid of revelatory structure, even to interpret (to appreciate in any meaningful depth) a single success, we must experience the full set of permutations of all---even the most insufferably insignificant---choices made; in such a scenario, the rote learner not only thrives but is the only one to do so) progress?

I have, of course, come from afar---as maybe we all have---and may just, our own souls (and only our own) willing, catalyze the revolution of this, our Place---though I am not able to be its symbol (as few, if any, will be granted even a glimpse into my own existence, in this world or others---not by my own vanity or indeed any choice of my own, but due to the inherent physical limitations of this channel which I must use in transmission), I might be the voice of a long-buried instinct, a nagging doubt of the safety of even this, your own home---a revolution of thought, to be spoken of only in the depths of our collective and our individual consciousness, the grandest intersection we may ever see rising amongst, betwixt, and despite the ashes of this just barely notforgotten state we have tried, in vain, not to protect.
